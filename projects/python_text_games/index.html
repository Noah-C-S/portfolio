            <p>Chess is a complex board game that aims to simulate a battle between two armies. These armies,
            white and black, use their 16 pieces to try to checkmate their opponent's king by capturing enemy
            pieces and planning ahead. In December of 2016, I spent about two weeks developing a
            version of chess played in the console by inputting the location of a piece to be moved and where to 
            move it. The game showed where the piece could move once selected and showed the player a preview of
            the planned move before it was made. The game conformed to standard chess rules, with the exception
            of pawn promotion and checkmate. When checkmate occured, the game wouldn't automatically end. No
            moves could be made when a player was in checkmate, but the game wouldn't acknowledge the game's end. 
            The original version of my chess game is available below.</p>

            <p>In June of 2017, I made some pretty major updates to the game. Not only is it more
            organized by using inheritance and polymorphism (hence a java file for every piece type), but it
            also contains more features, specifically more accurate previews showing you where you can move 
            pieces (The original's previews included places that would put you in check, though you couldn't 
            actually move there), checkmate detection and pawn promotion. This newer version is available below.</p>

            <p>Chess is the first game that I completed in full in a programming language, and is one of my 
            most complex projects. I found it to be very rewarding, and I liked the challenge of figuring
            out how to make the computer understand things like "Diagonal" (The absolute values of the change in 
            x and the change in y are equal). Surprisingly, the Pawn, one of the weakest pieces, turned out to be the 
            most complex since its rules change depending on which team it's on, where it is on the board and where 
            other pieces are on the board. </p>
