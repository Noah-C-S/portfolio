             <p>It's been a while since I've put something new on this website. That might give the impression that I haven't kept myelf busy over the past three years or so, but it's more that the
             nature of my work has changed. All of the prior work I have here was completely self-motivated, made using abilities that were mostly self-taught, and were not part of any organized course
             or curriculum. Since I entered college, however, I've been mostly satisifed with the assignments that I do for class, which have included a Kiosk application for Brigham and Women's hospital
             in Boston and a robot that delivers pizza. I don't publish most of the source code for these because professors often reuse projects or parts of projects for future terms and I don't want to
             just publish the answers on the internet. However, I've recently been working on a personal project called <a class = 'link' href = "https://github.com/Noah-C-S/SlippiMusic">SlippiMusic</a> which is more fitting for this website than my course projects, since it's completely Free software and is meant to be useful to other people.</p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I've been playing Super Smash Brothers Melee competitively for a little over three years now, and while in-person events are certainly preferable to online ones, playing the game online is
            still preferable to not playing it at all. Recently, some amazing developers have created a modification of Dolphin which allows for Melee to be played using rollback netcode. Most Netcode works by running a separate instance of the game on both players' computers and having each host send their inputs to the other. There is a fixed delay for all local and remote inputs, and if a remote input takes more time to arrive than the delay, the game freezes until it recieves the next input. However, this "delay-based" netcode is generally considered inferiror to "rollback netcode", where the game continues running while making guesses for the opponent's missing inputs. If the receieved inputs are different from the guess, then it "rolls back" the game and recalculates the characters' positions based on the received inputs. <a class = "link" href = "https://slippi.gg">Project Slippi</a> is an impressive implementation of Rollack Netcode for melee, but since we don't have melee's source code and use an emulator to run it, is rather imperfect; anything that is loaded from the disc and into memory at the start of the game works fine, but things such as stage music which are loaded from the disc during the game don't work. A lot of Melee's music is incredible and was recorded by a live orchestra. For many people, it's an important part of playing the game, so I created SlippiMusic to help improve the emulation of Melee while playing it online. It runs in the background and watches you play to determine which track it should play, and plays the correct one.</p>
