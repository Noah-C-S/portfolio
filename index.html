            <p>In the months preceding the summer vacation between Junior and Senior year, I noticed art students working with their art teachers to make portfolios for universities to look
            at. Art students do this to help make themselves stand out. I thought that since what I did was a form of art as well, I should make a portfolio too. However, I couldn't 
            just send in text files of my code or include chess in my Common app, I had to make a website to host the projects that I want to send to universities. </p>
            
            <p>I began work the moment after I finished up my AP exams for the 2016-2017 school year. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted from a portfolio website at the time, so I 
            just began work on something I thought would look cool using HTML canvas. I figured that I'd be able to implement it into my website
            somehow, and I eventually stuck it in the footer, at the bottom of the page. It's hidden by default, but clicking on the footer reveals it while subsequent clicks add lines.
             It's made up of many little dots that I like to call "nodes"
             that move around and connect to each other and the mouse with lines. The lines get fainter the further away the two nodes are. A node is just an array with 4 values in it. These
             values are  an x coordinate, a y coordinate an x direction and a y direction. The x and y directions are random values between -1 and 1 that determine how far the node should move
             in that particular direction every 50 milliseconds. This value is changed every time it touches the edge of the canvas to make sure that the node doesn't keep going in one 
             direction forever. There's a <a class = "link" href = "/canvas">full page version</a> that allows you to change the values of some variables as well by using sliders. I think
             this came out pretty well, but if I were to make it again right now, I'd probably take a more object oriented approach to </p>
