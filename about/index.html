             <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I'm Noah Preston Capucilli-Shatan. I was born and raised in New York City. Hiking, computers, politics and history are all things I'm interested in. I can also play the 
            Otamatone, which isn't the best sounding instrument, but it's certainly the cutest. I'm currently going to the Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology, which I chose because
            of my interest in software engineering. <br><br>
            I've been interested in software engineering since 7th grade when I made a mod for the video game Minecraft that added turtles to the game. The turtles had this cute little walk animation
            and dropped sad faces when they died. I didn't want to wait for college to persue computer science, so I only looked at high schools that offered computer science courses. So far, 
            I'm proficient in Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and I've used Python in the past. <br><br>
            One of my hobbies is the video game Super Smash Bros Melee. Released in 2001, Melee is the best selling game on the gamecube, and tournaments are still held 16 years after its release.
            I main fox, but I can also play a decent Marth, Falco and Pikachu. I was introduced to Melee in high school when I joined a club where we played Melee twice a week. <br><br>
