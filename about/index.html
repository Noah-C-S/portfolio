             <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I'm Noah Preston Capucilli-Shatan. I was born and raised in New York City. Hiking, computers, politics and history are some of the things I'm interested in. I can also play the 
            Otamatone, which isn't the best sounding instrument, but it's certainly the cutest. I'm currently attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute as an undergraduate computer science major with a minor in robotics engineering. <br><br>
            I didn't want to wait for college to pursue computer science, so I attended a high school that offered computer science courses. Right now, 
            I'm proficient in Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C, Oracle SQL, and I've used Python in the past. I've been interested in software engineering since 7th grade when I made a mod for the video game 
            Minecraft that added turtles to the game. The turtles had this cute little walk animation and dropped sad faces when they died.  <br><br>
            One of my hobbies is the video game Super Smash Bros Melee. Released in 2001, Melee is the best selling game on the gamecube, and tournaments are still held 20 years after its release.
            I main Fox and Marth, but I can also play a decent Ness. I was introduced to Melee in high school when I joined a club where we played Melee twice a week called Gamer
            Haven which was run by my CS teacher, Mr. Chen. Now, I run weekly Melee tournaments at my school, and have won some small tournaments as well.<br><br>
