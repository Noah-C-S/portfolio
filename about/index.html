             <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I'm Noah Preston Capucilli-Shatan, a high school student from New York City. My primary scholarly interests are Math, Science and History. Throughout my high school career, 
            I've challenged myself with AP classes in all 3 of those subjects, and gotten a 5 on at least one exam for all 3. Computer science, in particular, is an interest of mine. 
            I've been working with software engineering in one way or another for 6 years and I've wanted to make a career out of it since 7th grade, and chose a high school with a focus
            on technology so I could study computer science in high school and I hope to study Computer science in college as well.<br><br>
            In my free time, I like to write computer programs and play video games. The Legend of Zelda series is a personal favorite of mine. Europa Universalis IV is another game that I like
            to spend my time playing. EUIV is about starting as any sovereign nation from 1444-1821 and playing as that nation up until 1821, allowing for you to dramatically alter history. 
            I also like the Fire Emblem series of games. <br><br>
