I made this cool little faq thing from scratch. Originally, I used jQuery animations, but now it uses CSS3 animations which are better for simple animations like these.

<div class = "time" id = "t1"><h1>What libraries or APIs did you use to make this website?</h1>
<div class = "content shrunkC" id = "c1">I used jQuery, Detect Mobile Browser Hamburgers by Johnathan Suh<br><br>
jQuery was used with Detect Mobile Browser to detect when someone is using a mobile browser for certain scripts.<br><br>
The hamburgers API was used to make the cool animated hamburgers that I use on mobile. If you're unsure of what I'm talking about, lower your browser window's width to under 1000 pixels and it should replace the navigation in the upper right. <br><br>
These were primarily used to save myself time while developing this website </div>
